    "Throughout this course we have seen several methods for accessing the data we need for our analysis. Sometimes it might comes as a csv file, other times we might connect to a SQL database. What happens if the data you need is on the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where web scraping comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a tool for extracting information from the webpages that we can use in our analysis. In this workbook we will look at a couple of different ways of extracting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do they work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with websites is that they are (understandably) written for human consumption, not machines. If I want to get some information on a topic (say, how to write a web scraper) I can search for a website online and read the information myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "This works well for us, and if we wanted to extract some information from a website we can just write it down ourselves. If however, we want more data and want to do it automatically, we need a web scraping tool. But they cannot read website like we do, so they need a workaround. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is actually quite simple. When you build a web scraper you supply it with the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) where the information is stored and it will load the entire HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) code. You can then tell the scraper what parts of the HTML code you want and it will return it to you in a usable format. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we get into building web scrapers we need to think about the legal bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How legal is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer depends on the data you are extracting. If it is public data (i.e. on a public webpage like Wikipedia) then it is fair game and you can extract it. If it is private or confidential data then you cannot just take it (that would be illegal). For example, if the data is kept behind a paywall or within a secured server then you cannot extract it without the owner's permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue with web scraping is how it might affect a server. All web pages are hosted on a server somewhere on the planet, and there is only so much capacity they can handle. To give an example, think about when a popular artist releases tickets for an upcoming concert, potentially hundreds of thousands of fans may try and access the website at the same time. Unless the website has capacity or an effective funnel system in place, the website is liable to crash because the server cannot handle that many people accessing its content at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this relate to web scraping? When you write a scraper, it is effectively acting as a person accessing a website. However, computers can do this much faster than we can and if you are trying to access lots of data your scraper may be hitting the server multiple times per second. This can cause the server to slow down, or even crash (which the owner will not appreciate...). When we come to build the scraper we will look at how we can slow them down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to this then, many websites put into place CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) as a way to prevent web scrapers from crashing their website. It is likely you have seen one before (click on all the square with a bicycle, tick to confirm you are not a robot, etc). As these are not part of the HTML on the page when accessing the website, it is difficult to program the scraper to deal with them when they arise (which is what they are meant to do).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most website only put these tests at the end of a form, not on the initial page you are trying to find the data. But even then, there are still checks going on. Most websites will have in the background a CAPTCHA that is analysing the behaviour of someone accessing the website (mouse clicks and keystrokes for example). Most humans can't do hundreds of clicks a second, but a web scraper can. If these CAPTCHAs detect your scraper they may block the IP (Internet Protocol) address. Later we will look at how we can program a scraper to mimic human behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in CAPTCHAs, here is an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1zNIm8GVPY&t=316s&ab_channel=TomScott'>interesting video which describes them in more detail.</a>"

    "## APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into web scraping, we first need to look at Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). If you are looking to extract lots of data from a website, potentially to the point of causing problems on their server, you should check if they don't already give access via an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is an intermediary that allows your code to speak with a server, so for example, if you wanted to retrieve information from a website directly, you can use an API (if they have set one up) to access the data directly as opposed to scraping it. Many website which hold large amounts of data (e.g. Spotify) have APIs which you can use. Be careful to check their limit policy however, most website will only allow you to make a limited amount of requests per day/week/month for free. If you want to do more than that you will need to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do an example now with IMDb (Internet Movie Database). IMDb holds a lot of data on movies and tv shows for our own interest, but searching through the website manually can be a chore. To help anyone looking to use movie information as part of an analysis project, IMBd set up an API for us to access the data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Head to the <a href='https://imdb-api.com/api'>IMDb API</a> webpage and set up a free account (Register). You are allows to make 100 requests a day for free, which is plenty for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have confirmed your email, go back to the webpage and click on <b>IMDB API DOCUMENTATION</b> and take note of the <i>API Key</i>. This is your personal code for accessing the information on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's take a look at the code below to lookup Star Wars. To find any film you need to know its code, it can be found by looking at the URL of the webpage for that film - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/."

    "\n",
    "Web scrapers are fairly easy to build in python and have many applications. They are mostly used for automating data retrieval from websites where information is often changing. For example, if you need to the latest currency conversion from £ -> $ then you can write a scraper that collects this information and supplies it to your model automatically. This saves you from rewriting the model each time you need it to account for the currency change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, most websites will be fine with you scraping their data for non-profit reasons (like practising building a scraper). They may take exemption if you are doing it to make money, so you need to check the websites terms and conditions before you start. If you are scraping for business reasons, you would be better asking them or checking if there is an API you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another disadvantage of web scraping is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. All websites are different, and what works on one might not work on another. This isn't even taking into account that websites can change, so what works today might not work tomorrow. Again, using an API gets around this problem.\n",
